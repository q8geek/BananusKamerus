# BananusKamerus

This is a project I made in the little time I have juggling between school and my almost-one-year-old son (By the time I'm writing this page).
It's a PHP script(s) to control a Raspberry Pi to take pictures with their [new HQ Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) through wifi.

Installation guide can be [found here](http://q8geek.com/2020/12/26/bananus-kamerus-v10/).

Please let me know if there's anything I missed to update this project.
